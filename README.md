# :robot: Defining Classes

## 🤓 Overview and learning outcomes 

Classes are a powerful tool in any Object Oriented Language.  In this lab, you will learn to define classes and create classes with attributes.

The goal of this lab is to begin defining classes in Python. 🚀

#### Over the course of this lab you will do a number of things:
1. Create your own class definitions.
2. Define attributes of classes.
3. Create objects which contain attributes from these classes.

## 💻 Terms to know
- classes
- attributes
- methods

## 📝 Next steps
1. Complete the work in the notebook here (5_6_2_Classes.ipynb) using the CoLab interface.
2. In this repository (you don't have to use your Raspberry Pi, if you do not want to) write a Python script that does the following:
    - Define any new class which contains at least two parameters.
    - Use those paramaters to define attributes in the class definition.
    - Add at least one method to the class which may be used to return information by the user of the script.
3. Write an "observations.md" file in this repo that explains what you learned in this lab.
