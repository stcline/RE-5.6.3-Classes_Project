# :robot: Defining Classes

## 🤓 Overview and learning outcomes 

We are finally here, final project of our programming unit.  In this lab, you will use a class that may be instantiated to control an RGB LED with your Raspberry Pi.

The goal of this lab is to extend your use of classes to build a usable script. 🚀

#### Over the course of this lab you will do a number of things:
1. Learn to use an RGB LED with a Raspberry Pi.
2. Build a class which may be instantiated and called later.
2. (Optional) Put your class in a custom module.

## 💻 Terms to know
- classes
- attributes
- methods
- argument
- instantiation
- PWM signals
- duty cycle

## 📝 Next steps
1. Clone this repo to your Raspberry Pi.
2. Using a breadboard, resistors, jumper wires and an RGB LED, build your prototype as directed in the last link in the resources below.
3. Build a class within a script to control an RGB LED as follows (you may use the starter code found in `RGB_Control.py` if you like):
    - The user is a asked for a red, green and blue duty cycle.
    - The user is asked for a duration the light will stay on.
    - The light activated according to those parameters and then shuts off.
4. Add and commit your new script to the local repo.
5. Push your changes here.
